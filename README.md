## A short script for randomly selecting students to present exercises

Run the script and give the name of a correctly formatted CSV-file in the same directory when prompted (withou the `.csv` file ending), like so:

``` shellsession
$ python3 generator.py
> Which exercise sheet: test
> Done!
```
You get the results in a markdown [file][https://github.com/mzeuner/AssignPresentations/blob/main/presentations_test.md].
